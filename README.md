# Avengers Fist

This project is for the Avengers Fist website!


## Installation

Before you start, you'll need to set up the project:

1. **Install dependencies:** Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download all the necessary libraries needed by the project.

### *Running the Project*

There are several ways to run the Avengers Fist project, depending on your needs:

**1. Development Mode:**

```Bash
npm run start
```
This starts the development server, allowing you to see changes you make to the code reflected live in the browser (usually at http://localhost:8080). This is ideal for active development.

**2. Production Build:**

```Bash
npm run build
```
This creates an optimized production build of your application in the dist folder. This build is suitable for deployment to a web server.

**3. Previewing the Production Build:**

Once you have a production build (using npm run build), you can start the server for the built files:

```Bash
npm run preview
```
This will typically build and serve the application from the dist folder (usually at http://localhost:8081).
